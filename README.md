# Variational Inference on TrueSkill Model
The original Trueskill paper from 2007 used message passing. Carl Rasmussen's assignment uses Gibbs sampling. In this project I will approximate posterior distributions with both gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and gradient-based stochastic variational inference.
